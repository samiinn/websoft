        <p>My name is Edmir Suljic, born i Örebro in 1996. I moved to Malmö in 1999 and have been there ever since. I
            graduated from Malmö Borgarskola in 2015 and took a break for 2 years where I worked a bit.</p>

        <p>I have always been interested in computers (like everyone else in here I suppose), but did not even consider
            studying programming until late 2016 when my friend who is a programmer suggested it.</p>

        <p>My hobbies mostly include music. I play guitar, have been for 7 years. I suppose it would be my main passion
            but unfortunately it does not always pay the bills so programming it is.</p>

        <p>I do like to try new things all the time, but sticking to it might be the biggest challenge. Maybe it's a
            generational thing.</p>
