                <p class="report-questions">1) Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or
                    GitHub Pages?
                </p>
                <p> We have previously worked with Git and GitHub in our school projects. I was familiar with some of
                    the commands used today like commit, push, clone, git status, mkdir etc. But I did not know about
                    git pages or adding tags. </p>
                <p class="report-questions">
                    2) Have you ever created websites before?</p>
                <p>I have not worked with creating websites before. But i have experience using JSON files from our
                    Software Engineering course.
                    We also have experience in working with http protocols and restApi from the Network Applications
                    course.
                </p>
                <p class="report-questions">
                    3) Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development. </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned, unfortunately, I have not worked with web development before, but I did some very
                    small side studies on JavaScript React.
                    I think as you showed us today on the job application, it is one of the necessary tools to know
                    nowadays.
                    websites are one of the main tools that companies use to communicate with their clients, and it is
                    key in increasing the popularity of the companies.
                    I also think websites are a really cool way to give people information, in a way they can read and
                    understand.
                </p>
                <p class="report-questions"> 4) What is your TIL for this course section? </p>
                <p>
                    Today I learned more about git commands, how to create git pages, how to create a file and add it to
                    your git repo, and how to add tags to your commits.
                    I also would like to mention that the way you walk us through everything, step by step, is really
                    helping in understanding it.

                <p class="report-questions">1) Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript? </p>
                <p> I did not work with any of them before, however I worked a bit with styling on JavaFx, as well as on
                    android platform. Which on both you are not having a separate styling sheet(CSS) or a separate
                    skeleton like html. there is only an XML file that you can use, in order to style your components.
                </p>
                <p class="report-questions">
                    2) Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development </p>
                <p> HTML is what the web page is going to look like. It has the components of the page inside of it and
                    it is a skeleton for the webpage.
                    CSS is how the page is going to look like, it is a styling sheet for the HTML components. So that
                    you can connect your HTML file to the CSS file and style your components.
                    JS allows you to have executable code in the webpage. Its used to create responsive, interactive
                    elements for web pages, enhancing the user experience.
                </p>
                <p class="report-questions">
                    3) Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts. </p>
                <p>
                    The browser complies the code and it uses HTTP protocols to interact with the web server. in oder
                    words, the browser request a resource from the server,
                    and the server responses back with the resource, and this communication is done over HTTP protocol.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today I have learned about HTML elements, CSS and a bit of java script.
                    Today we have worked with CSS mostly, and how to style the webpage using it. Also how to inspect
                    elements using the browser.
                    For example, how to change the colors, fonts, shapes of elements.

                <p class="report-questions"> 1) Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
                <p>
                    I have not worked with Js before at all. I just have studied a bit on it and watch some small
                    tutorials.</p>
                <p class="report-questions">
                    2) Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
                <p>
                    In some ways I can find similarities to Java, for example the logic of it, as well as some
                    functionalities like "function" seen we had something similar in java (Methods). However it is not
                    surprising since they are both programming languages.
                    However I found javaScript, easier to understand. It basically have this "simplicity" that I like
                    more, than in Java.
                    JavaScript is also easier to debug than java to me.</p>
                <p class="report-questions">
                    3) Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code
                    turn out to be?</p>
                <p>
                    I aimed for grade 5, however it required more time than I expected. I started my way up from grade
                    3, the fetch function took the most time for me, but then I could be more comfortable with grade 4
                    requirements. Right now I am on grade 4, although I have added the hiding/ showing functionality for
                    flags required for grade 5.</p>
                <p class="report-questions">
                    4) What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                <p>
                    This section helped me to use CSS and HTML more and learn them better. As well as, since we started
                    with JavaScript, I started to learn about functions like fetch and event listeners, and some
                    functionalities like Timers.
                    I also learned about HTML tables and how to style them.</p>

                <p class="report-questions">1) Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal
                    programming tools.</p>
                <p>
                    I have not worked with node.js before this course. However, since I had to start learning it because
                    of my thesis project, I started to watch some tutorials about it before we reach this section of the
                    course. On the thesis project we have also worked with npm package manager to install the
                    dependencies.</p>
                <p class="report-questions">
                    2) How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
                <p>
                    As I have mentioned in previous reports, I started to like javascript a lot. I like how simple and
                    straight forward it is to understand. I also think node.js makes it a lot easier for JavaScript
                    programmers to take care of the backend side of their programs by not needing to learn a new
                    language. </p>
                <p class="report-questions">
                    3) Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
                <p>
                    I started with following the preparation and googled where I was stuck. after completing the
                    preparation I tried to use it and connect it to those parts of the actual task that was
                    needed.</p>
                <p class="report-questions">
                    4) What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
                <p>
                    Frankly, I got a bit behind my timing plan for this task. Since I have 2 other projects going on at
                    the same time I couldn't put the time I wanted to for achieving grade 5, so I just went for grade
                    3.<br>
                    the instruction of the task was quite straight forward so I did not have a problem with getting
                    along with grade 3. </p>
                <p class="report-questions">
                    5) What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                <p>
                    I learned how to set up a server with node and express. Also how the middleware works with express.

                <p class="report-questions"> 1) How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>
                <p>PHP was easy to start with to me, I suppose for a server side application PHP can be easier to use.
                </p>
                <p class="report-questions"> 2) Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>
                <p>I would like to compare it to javascript, however javascript is a client side and php is a server
                    side language. Since they were both new languages to me, one similarity to me was that it was easy
                    to start with them. That can be because I was not new to programming and I knew Java already. I also
                    really liked that javascript could be executed in the browser while PHP cannot. On the other hand
                    php
                    supports databases.</p>
                <p class="report-questions">3) Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for
                    and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
                <p>I started with watching some tutorials on YouTube, then followed the preparation to install the tools
                    needed. I had some difficulties getting the XAMPP to work but in the end I managed. I aimed for
                    grade 3 and I finished the task for that grade.</p>
                <p class="report-questions"> 4) What is your TIL for this course </p>
                <p>In this part I learned about basic programming in PHP and get going with connecting it to a database.

                <p class="report-questions">1) What is your own opinion on the popularity of programming languages and
                    what
                    are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</p>
                <p>Based on the tiobe.com website, at the moment Java is at the top of the list. C and Python are next
                    accordingly. However, I think JavaScript will get higher in the list if we give it some time.<br>
                    Based on the survey that StackOverflow published at the end of 2019, JavaScript was on the top of
                    the list as the most popular based on google searches and job ads. <br> Check the survey on
                    StackOverflow <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology"
                        style="font-size: 15px;">here</a>.</p>
                <p class="report-questions">2) What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?
                </p>
                <p>Although I feel more confident in java since I started with JavaScript I feel like I can relate to it
                    more and I am interested in the differences of it from Java. one of the reasons I would choose
                    JavaScript is that it has a lot of frameworks that you can use, so there is a lot you can do without
                    building it from scratch. Also since it is a popular language, in case of having problems, it is
                    easy to find solutions because there are probably already people who asked that.<br> For the
                    backend, I would choose either nodeJS express or Python. <br> nodeJs because then I can have the
                    same language for both front and backend. Python because of its strengths in connection to the
                    server-side and fetching data.</p>
                <p class="report-questions"> 3) Do your investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external
                    site.) to customize your comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the
                    results.</p>
                <p>I have compared JavaScript, PHP , Java, and nodeJS. <br> in the past 5 years in Sweden Java was the
                    most popular, then JavaScript, PHP, and nodeJS accordingly after. </p>
                <p class="report-questions">4) If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your
                    potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</p>
                <p>I would suggest JavaScript for front-end because of the same reasoning I have above and PHP or Python
                    for making APIs and taking data from database.</p>
                <p class="report-questions"> 5) What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                <p>I have learned about the tools available to find out the latest trends in IT and how to do a small
                    research about the latest technologies. Also what to value when it comes to big projects and how to
                    decide wisely about the tools being used.

                <p class="report-questions">1) Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer,
                    but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</p>
                <p>.Net frame work is based on OOP (Object Oriented Programming) so like Java in provides Interfaces,
                    abstracts, etc. .Net is strongly typed (maybe not as much as type script) and it contains a lot of
                    pre built in methods and syntax.</p>
                <p class="report-questions">2) Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we
                    learned during the course.</p>
                <p>.Net platform is a computing platform layer that is positioned above the windows operating system.
                    Also, .Net is language independent and supports multiple languages such as c# and J# and it offers
                    different technologies and services that are needed in order to build applications. I have chosen
                    PHP, one of the programming languages we learned during the course, to compare with .Net : <br>
                    First thing to notice is that PHP is an open source, server side language while .NET is licensed.
                    PHP is interpreted and .net needs to be compiled.<br>
                    PHP is mostly being used to build websites while .NET is also being used for developing desktop
                    applications as well as web.</p>

                    and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
                <p> I started to prepare myself with the preparation examples. Then I moved on to the tasks. I started
                    with the console application which was easier. On the console application I did not have much of a
                    problem since I could find a lot of similarities in how I would have written the code in Java.
                    <br>The Web application was a bit more complex. However since we have had worked with json file and
                    fetching previously in the course and how to put it in an HTML table, it went smoothly. I have aimed
                    for grade 3. </p>
                <p class="report-questions">4) What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                <p>In this part of the course I got to learn about .Net frame work and technologies, and how to fetch,
                    read and use the jsonReader class in a C# program. I also learned about how to have a basic web
                    application in C# and how to generate and use different classes (Models,Services) inside the
                    program.</p>

                    <br> <br> Edmir Suljic and I chose tretton37.com, eppnetwork.com, and hkr.se.
                    These three websites are chosen based on the common interest that we had/have in them. hkr.se is our
                    school website, tretton37.com is where we are taking our internship at, and eppnetwork.com is a
                    website that we contributed with, to make an android application for them.
                    The similarities of these websites are that they are not used by tons of people at the same time
                    daily, like for example facebook.com, so we decided to compare websites that are kind of on the same
                    level of accessibility to make the comparison fair.
                    <br><br>
                    Based on the the definition that Google has for google audit, web performance audit calculate
                    factors independently to show the websites response time and performance, as well as suggesting code
                    examples to replace with the less efficient code.
                    <br><br> lighthouse report suggested the following for the websites that we tested : <br><br>
                    tretton37.com: Unused CSS can be removed which will results in 0.45 s of time saving. <br>
                    Minimization of main-thread work. <br>Reduce javaScript execution time. <br> Not to use HTTP/2 for
                    all of its resources. (30 requests not saved via HTTP/2). <br>
                    Not to include front-end JavaScript libraries with known security vulnerabilities.<br><br>
                    eppnetwork.com: Avoid enormous network payloads. <br> Having a more efficient cache policy.<br>
                    Avoid chaining critical requests.<br><br>
                    hkr.se: In order to lower the time to interactive, offscreen and hidden images can be loaded after the necessary resources has been loaded.
                    Avoid importing unused CSS rules.
                    Reduction in the time that is used to parse, compile and execute the JS code and having smaller JS payloads can help the matter.
                    <br><br>

                    What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                <p>I have learned about tools for performance testing a website and how to make the websites response
                    time faster. Auditing the website in general will help in a better performance experience. An audit
                    also gives you a baseline for data-driven development. </p>

                <p class="report-questions">1) Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your
                    own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.</p>
                <p> 1- Login Authentication: showing user’s username and password on network tab when sending the
                    request to the backend!
                    It makes this possibility for hackers to find user’s credential and they can reveal easily user’s
                    personal data (which is against GDPR). This problem is mentioned in OWASP as "A3-Sensitive Data
                    Exposure". <br><br>
                    2. SQL injection: being able to login to the web page without having a valid password! It means that
                    we only check if the username is right and we do not check the password. It means that everyone who
                    has the username, can get logged in and have access to user’s personal data (which is against
                    GDPR).This is also the first on the list of OWASP. According to OWASP this problem can happen in any
                    kind of system such as a web program written in PHP while sending data to MySQL database, when the
                    program is transferring the user input to a mail server, and etc. <br><br>
                    3. Websites should create a cookie session and session ID for each valid session. These cookies
                    usually carry important data like username, password and probably user’s personal information. When
                    the session is ended (when the user gets logged out or timeout or browser closed abruptly), these
                    cookies should be invalidated. If they do not get invalidated, the data will stay in the system and
                    hackers can have access to the user’s personal data easily by checking the cookies. This problem is
                    also mentioned in the list as "A2-Broken Authentication".
                </p>
                <p class="report-questions">2) Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the
                    topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.</p>
                <p>As users are trusting to us by proving their personal information, then we are responsible to keep
                    their information hidden in all ways. Our highest priority should be providing a safe web app for
                    users. We can easily make that by multi-factoring authentications. It means that instead of asking
                    users to type their passwords, we can use other ways like face-recognition. And we can add timeout
                    session for making cookies invalid!</p>
                <p class="report-questions">3) What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                <p>In this part I have learned about the common weaknesses and vulnerabilities that hackers can use to
                    misuse and access websites, how they usually happen and what is the solution to fix them.I also
                    have learned about GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) framework and some of it guidelines.

                <h2 class="report-title-h2">S10</h2>
                <p class="report-questions">1) Write a general paragraph about how the project was implemented. Problems / solutions / simple / difficult / fast / long time, etc. Was the project easy or difficult? Did it take a long time? What was difficult and what went easy? Was this a good and reasonable project for this course? How was it to work in a team?</p>
                <p>We divided our group of 4 people, into 2 groups; back-end and front-end. I was working in the front-end group and we were using React as our JavaScript library and Material UI as our React framework. The reason we chose these two frameworks was that we in the front-end group, were both familiar and felt comfortable with using them.<br><br>

                    Regarding the timing of the project, it took a longer time than expected. I suppose we underestimated the workload in the beginning. The volume of work that the front-end had to do was a bit too much, (probably was the same for the back-end people), therefore I can say that it was not too easy for us to implement everything in a short time. And sometimes the tasks were dependent on each other, so it was taking even a longer time. Especially since we were working in distance because of the corona situation, and we could not help each other easily when we had problems.
                    Implementing the whole project including the time we put to figure out what to do, took approximately three weeks. Although, I think the last additional days to the deadline was really helpful for us. <br><br>
                     
                    I was not unfamiliar with react and JavaScript, but since in this project, we were only two people doing the whole front-end part I can say that it got a bit difficult at some points for me. (comparing when you are 3-4 people on the front-end team, that I was used to.)  <br><br>
                    
                    The project as I mentioned above, was a big project. An end to end project including implementing the database, server, UI design, front-end functionality and etc. Therefore, besides the fact that it was challenging I think that it was a great chance to practice what we learned during the course and also to sum up our knowledge in web development. <br><br>
                    
                    The team that I was working with are all really helpful and knowledgeable. We four have all been working together on multiple projects before and were familiar with each other's way of thinking and working as a team member. During the development process, we planned a couple of weekly meetings on Discord in order to share our progress on our tasks. I think we had a smooth way of communication and problem-solving. Overall I think it was a great experience to work with them again and to be able to use what we learned on different parts of this course on a bigger aspect in this project. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="report-questions">2) Finish with a final paragraph with your thoughts on the course and what you think about the material and the guide (about 5-10 sentences). Provide feedback to teachers and suggest any improvement suggestions for upcoming course opportunities. Are you satisfied / dissatisfied? Will you recommend the course to your friends / colleagues? On a scale of 1-10, what grade do you give the course?</p>
                    <p>Overall, I think the course was really structured, with clear instructions on the tasks and what is required for a specific grade on different assignments. The lectures were really interesting and engaging and it was great that the teacher was always there to answer the questions and to help us with the assignments. Moreover, the way everything was handled in the corona situation was also really neat and impressive.<br><br>
                        The only thing that I would like to recommend for the future is narrowing the subjects mentioned in the course. In that case, we would build a bigger and better knowledge of one or two specific subjects rather than a small knowledge of too many languages and frameworks. However, I totally understand that the purpose of the course is to introduce us to the technologies used in web development.
                        </p>
                        <p class="report-questions">3) What is your final TIL for this course?</p>
                        <p>This course was a good combination of the frameworks and technologies one needs to be familiar with in order to be able to move further towards becoming a web developer. I have learned a lot on both back-ends, front-end and security aspects of web development as well as gaining skills on how to research and compare different programming languages, frameworks and etc. This comparison was also helpful to gain a good knowledge of what is worth spending time to learn on a deeper level. For example, If it is popular or going to be popular among the companies and other dev tools. <br><br>
                            Also, since we were using git for all of our uploads and downloads, I could expand my git command knowledge as well as practicing a lot of front-end skills, something we did not have during the program earlier, which was really nice.
