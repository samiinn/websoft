<h2>S01</h2>
<p>1)Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
    We have previously worked with Git and GitHub in our school projects. I was familiar with some of the commands used today like commit, push, clone, git status, mkdir etc. But I did not know about git pages or adding tags.
    <br>
    2)Have you ever created websites before?
    I have not worked with creating websites before. But i have experience using JSON files from our Software Engineering course.
    We also have experience in working with http protocols and restApi from the Networok Applications course.
    <br>
    3)Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
    As mentioned, unfortunately, I have not worked with web development before, but I did some very small side studies on java scrip React. 
    I think as you showed us today on the job application, it is one of the necessary tools to know nowadays. 
    websites are one of the main tools that companies use to communicate with their clients, and it is key in increasing the popularity of the companies.
    I also think websites are a really cool way to give people information, in a way they can read and understand.
    <br>
    4)What is your TIL for this course section?
    Today I learned more about git commands, how to create git pages, how to create a file and add it to your git repo, and how to add tags to your commits.
    I also would like to mention that the way you walk us through everything, step by step, is really helping in understanding it.

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>1) Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
    I did not work any of them before, however I worked a bit with styling on JavaFx.
    <br>
   2) Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development
   HTML is what the web page is going to look like. it is a skeleton for the webpage.
   CSS is how the page is going to look like. it is styling sheet of the page.
   JS allows you to have executable code in the webpage. so that the website can be dynamic.
    <br>
   3) Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts
   The browser complies the code and it uses HTTP protocols to interact with the web server. in oder words, the browser request a resource from the server,
   and the server responses back with the resource, and this communication is done over HTTP protocol.
    <br>
   4) What is your TIL for this course section?
   Today I have learned about HTML elements, CSS and a bit of java script.
   Today we have worked with CSS mostly, and how to style the webpage using it. Also how to inspect elements using the browser.
   For example, how to change the colors, fonts, shapes of elements.
