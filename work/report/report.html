<p>1) Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
    <br> <br> We have previously worked with Git and GitHub in our school projects. I was familiar with some of the commands used today like commit, push, clone, git status, mkdir etc. But I did not know about git pages or adding tags.
    <br>
    <br>
    2) Have you ever created websites before? <br><br>
    I have not worked with creating websites before. But i have experience using JSON files from our Software Engineering course.
    We also have experience in working with http protocols and restApi from the Networok Applications course.
    <br>
    <br>
    3) Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development. <br><br>
    As mentioned, unfortunately, I have not worked with web development before, but I did some very small side studies on javascrip React. 
    I think as you showed us today on the job application, it is one of the necessary tools to know nowadays. 
    websites are one of the main tools that companies use to communicate with their clients, and it is key in increasing the popularity of the companies.
    I also think websites are a really cool way to give people information, in a way they can read and understand.
    <br>
    <br>
    4) What is your TIL for this course section? <br><br>
    Today I learned more about git commands, how to create git pages, how to create a file and add it to your git repo, and how to add tags to your commits.
    I also would like to mention that the way you walk us through everything, step by step, is really helping in understanding it.

<p>1) Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript? <br><br>
    I did not work with any of them before, however I worked a bit with styling on JavaFx, as well as on 
    android platform. Which on both you are not having a seperate styling sheet(CSS) or a seperate skeleton like html. there is only an XML file that you can use, in order to style your components.
    <br>
    <br>
   2) Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development <br><br>
   HTML is what the web page is going to look like. It has the components of the page inside of it and it is a skeleton for the webpage.
   CSS is how the page is going to look like, it is a styling sheet for the HTML components. So that you can connect your HTML file to the CSS file and style your components. 
   JS allows you to have executable code in the webpage. Its used to create responsive, interactive elements for web pages, enhancing the user experience.
    <br>
    <br>
   3) Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts. <br><br>
   The browser complies the code and it uses HTTP protocols to interact with the web server. in oder words, the browser request a resource from the server,
   and the server responses back with the resource, and this communication is done over HTTP protocol.
    <br>
    <br>
   4) What is your TIL for this course section? <br><br>
   Today I have learned about HTML elements, CSS and a bit of java script.
   Today we have worked with CSS mostly, and how to style the webpage using it. Also how to inspect elements using the browser.
   For example, how to change the colors, fonts, shapes of elements.

<h2 class="report-title-h2">S03</h2>
<p> 1) Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?<br><br>
    I have not worked with Js before at all. I just have studied a bit on it and watch some small tutorials.<br><br>
    2) Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?<br><br>
    In some ways I can find similarities to Java, for example the logic of it, as well as some functionalities like "function" seen we had something similar in java (Methods). However it is not surprising since they are both programming languages.
    However I found javaScript, easier to undrestand. It basically have this "simplicity" that I like more, than in Java.
    JavaScript is also easier to debug than java to me.<br><br>
    3) Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?<br><br>
    I aimed for grade 5, however it required more time than I expected. I started my way up from grade 3, the fetch funtion took the most time for me, but then I could be more comfortable with grade 4 requirments. Right now I am on grade 4.<br><br>
    4) What is your TIL for this course section?<br><br>
    This section helped me to use CSS and HTML more and learn them better. As well as, since we started with JavaScript, I started to learn about functions like fetch and event listeners, and some functionalities like Timers. 
    I also learned about HTML tables and how to style them.</p>
