1)Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
We have previously worked with Git and GitHub in our school projects. I was familiar with some of the commands used today like commit, push, clone, git status, mkdir etc. But I did not know about git pages or adding tags.

2)Have you ever created websites before?
I have not worked with creating websites before. But i have experience using JSON files from our Software Engineering course.
We also have experience in working with http protocols and restApi from the Network Applications course.

3)Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
As mentioned, unfortunately, I have not worked with web development before, but I did some very small side studies on java scrip React. 
I think as you showed us today on the job application, it is one of the necessary tools to know nowadays. 
websites are one of the main tools that companies use to communicate with their clients, and it is key in increasing the popularity of the companies.
I also think websites are a really cool way to give people information, in a way they can read and understand.

4)What is your TIL for this course section?
Today I learned more about git commands, how to create git pages, how to create a file and add it to your git repo, and how to add tags to your commits.
I also would like to mention that the way you walk us through everything, step by step, is really helping in understanding it.
